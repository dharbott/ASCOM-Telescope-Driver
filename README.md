# ASCOM-Telescope-Driver
Here Lies All the Code that will be responsible for connecting the simple AltAz motorized telescope with the ASCOM Platform/Client.

If you're wondering, go here http://ascom-standards.org/
ASCOM is a software platform for computerized telescope makers and telescope application creators. I'm working within the ASCOM standard to develop a driver that will interface with the arduino controlled motorized telescope that we're building. It will eventually implement many of the basic telescope hardware driver functions that would be necessary for basic scope control by a basic sky pointing astrometric ASCOM client.
